*The potential of large-scale training data for universal image restoration. (a) Analysis of universal image restoration performance in real-world scenarios as training data vary. As the size of real-world training data increases, the image restoration model can achieve significant performance improvement. (b) Our proposed FoundIR, trained on our million-scale dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of image restoration tasks compared to existing universal image restoration methods.*

### :computer: Evaluation

#### :arrow_right: Environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

#### :arrow_right: Testing the Generalist Model
- Download the [pre-trained model](https://github.com/House-Leo/FoundIR/releases/download/Premodel/model-2000.pt) and put it in the `./premodel` folder.

<details open>
<summary><b>For our testset:</b></summary>

- download the [testset](#testset--visual-results) and organize them as follows:

```
    |--dataset
    |    |--01Blur
    |    |    |--GT
    |    |    |    |--0001.png
    |    |    |    |--0002.png
    |    |    |    |...
    |    |    |--LQ
    |    |    |    |--0001.png
    |    |    |    |--0002.png
    |    |    |    |...
    |    |--02Blur_Noise
    |    |    |--GT
    |    |    |    |--0151.png
    |    |    |    |--0152.png
    |    |    |    |...
    |    |    |--LQ
    |    |    |    |--0151.png
    |    |    |    |--0152.png
    |    |    |    |...
    |    | ...
```
- Run the following command to test the generalist model.
```
python test.py --dataroot ./dataset --meta ./Testset_meta_info.txt
```
</details>

<details close>

<summary><b>For your own data:</b></summary>

- Put the testset in the `./dataset/LQ` folder (simply copy the LQ folder and rename it `GT` if you don't have GT images.).
- Recomment L40-L44 in `test.py` to test your own data.
```
## For our testset
# dataset = CombinedDataset(opt, image_size, augment_flip=False, equalizeHist=True, crop_patch=False, generation=False, task='meta_info')

## For your own data
dataset = CombinedDataset(opt, image_size, augment_flip=False, equalizeHist=True, crop_patch=False, generation=False, task=None)
```
- Run the following command to test the generalist model.
```
python test.py --dataroot ./dataset --meta None
```

</details>

**(If you have a GPU with less than 24GB, you can reduce the `crop_size` on `test.py` L102.)**

#### :arrow_right: Testing the Specialist Models (Optional)
We provide two specialist models, i.e., **Lowlight** and **Weather** models, to refine the results of the generalist model.

In our experiments, we refine the generalist model's outputs as follows:
```
Weather model: 0501-0700 and 1051-1100 inputs
Lowlight model: 0701-0800, 1101-1250, and 1301-1500 inputs
```

**Please note that this is optional**, allowing you to further refine the generalist model’s outputs using the following commands, especially for challenging **lowlight, hazy, and rainy** inputs.

- Install the environment.
```
cd ./specialist_model
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```
- Put the testset in the `./dataset` folder.
- Run the following command to test the specialist models.
```
python inference_lowlight.py
or
python inference_weather.py
```
And you can find the output visual results in the folder `results/`.

#### :arrow_right: Evaluation Metrics
- Install the [pyiqa](https://github.com/chaofengc/IQA-PyTorch) package. Thanks to [Chaofeng Chen](https://github.com/chaofengc).
```
pip install pyiqa
```
- Run the following command to calculate the metrics.
```
python cal_metrics.py --inp_imgs ./dataset/restored --gt_imgs ./dataset/GT --log ptah_save_log
```

### :computer: Training

Our FoundIR is trained in two stages, please follow the steps in `train.sh` to train the model.
